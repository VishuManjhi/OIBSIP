Hello Everyone, This repository contains all the tasks that I had to complete in my internship at Oasis InfoByte. I had to complete fours tasks in the domain of Web Development and Designing which were as follows :-

1- Building a calculator which could perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and Division using HTML, CSS and JS.
2- Making a Tribute page for someone I admired which included use of basic HTML and CSS.
3- Buidling an online To Do Web list app which can record your tasks and also mark them as completed or pending according to their status using HTML,CSS and JS.
4- Building a login/registration page using JavaScript which verifies your username and password and upon successful login leads you to a second page.
