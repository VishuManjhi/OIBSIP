            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born on February 19, 1630, in the Shivneri Fort, Pune, to Shahaji Bhosle, a Maratha general,
                 and Jijabai. From a young age, Shivaji Maharaj displayed remarkable courage and leadership qualities. 
                 He was deeply influenced by his mother, Jijabai, who instilled in him a strong sense of justice and a devotion to Hindu culture.
            </p>

            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                Shivaji Maharaj founded the Maratha Empire in western India by establishing a well-organized and disciplined army
                 and pioneering the use of guerrilla warfare tactics. He successfully defended his kingdom against the powerful Mughal Empire
                  and other neighboring sultanates. In 1674, he was formally crowned as the Chhatrapati (Monarch) of his realm at Raigad Fort.

            <p>
                One of Shivaji Maharaj's most notable achievements was his naval strategy. He built a strong navy and fortified 
                coastlines to protect the empire from foreign invaders. This emphasis on a strong navy was a revolutionary concept 
                in Indian warfare at the time.
            </p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's legacy extends far beyond his military achievements. He was a just and fair ruler,
                 known for his progressive policies and administrative reforms. His Ashta Pradhan (Council of Eight Ministers) laid 
                 the foundation for an efficient and effective governance system. Shivaji Maharaj is remembered not only as a warrior king 
                 but also as a visionary leader who sought to build a strong, independent, and just society.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, Shivaji Maharaj is revered as a national hero in India, particularly in Maharashtra. His life and achievements continue
                 to inspire countless people across the country. Statues, monuments, and institutions named after him stand as 
                 a testament to his enduring legacy.
